# Friedmann Equation

Computing all 64 Christoffel symbols, then the Ricci tensor, contracting it to get the Einstein tensor, and finally deriving the Friedmann and Cosmic Acceleration equations is a tedious and error-prone process. One misplaced minus sign can ruin the entire calculation.
This code automates the process using SymPy, ensuring that each step—from the Christoffel symbols to the Ricci tensor and Einstein tensor—is correctly calculated. It ultimately derives the Friedmann equations and the acceleration equation in a clean, symbolic form, saving time and minimizing mistakes.
